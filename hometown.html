              Chintpurni Temple is an important religious centre located at an
              elevation of 940 m above sea level in Una. This temple is regarded
              as one of the most important Shakti Peethas, places of worship
              sanctified to the Hindu Goddess Shakti. Devoted to the Hindu deity
              Chintpurni Devi, this temple is situated at a distance of 3 km
              from Bharwain. The temple was founded by a Saraswat Brahman called
              Pandit Mai Das. The prime attraction of the temple is the garbha
              griha, the innermost sanctum of a Hindu temple, having a statue of
              the goddess. This stone temple has the main entrance facing to the
              north, and at the entrance there are the idols of Hindu deities
              namely, Ganesh and Hanuman. The deity is in the form of a stone
              idol, which is also known as pindi. This idol is placed in a
              palanquin made of white marble. The western part of the temple
              roof is adorned with stone images of Hindu gods such as Bhairon
              and Hanuman. In the premises of the temple is a banayan tree,
              where the first hair cutting ceremony known as ‘mundana’ of
              children is performed. Chintpurni Fair, also known as ‘Mata Da
              Mela’ is organised thrice in the Chintpurni Village every year.
              This fair is celebrated in the Hindu months of Chet (March-April),
              Sawan (July-August) and Asanj (September-October). This fair is
              organised near the temple devoted to the Hindu Goddess Bhagwati
              Chhinmastaka. According to belief, the Goddess appeared in astral
              form in the ancient era. The fair lasts for nine days during the
              Hindu festival of Navratras and for ten days in Sawan.
